                <h2>COMP1002 HTML, CSS, and JS Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>Professor: Sayed Alam</p>
                <p>Name: Sergio Cutrim Gouveia</p>
                <p>Student ID: 200579843</p>
                <h2>Assignment 2 (CSS)</h2>
                <h3>INSTRUCTIONS and EXPLANATION</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="question">1. Pick an interesting movie poster (with enough image resolution to make out all the text).</li>
                    <li class="answer"> I chose JAWS since it is a movie from my childhood and I always loved the poster.</li>
                    <li class="question">2. Type out all of the textual copy from the poster into a code editor.</li>
                    <li class="answer"> All the text was typed including the white letter in the bottom of the poster.</li>
                    <li class="question">3. Mark up each part of the resulting document with a variety of HTML sectioning and phrasing elements.</li>
                    <li class="answer"> I used header, footer and div in the main site, also I have user a, p, br and some other 
                        phrasing elements in the Original Poster and also in the About html.</li>
                    <li class="question">4. Include a few useful hyperlinks to the official movie website and/or some reviews.</li>
                    <li class="answer">I have included 2 links, one for the trailer and another one for the IMDB website in 
                        the end of the page - hidden in the last line</li>
                    <li class="question">5. Add some interesting images to the page to make the poster look more convincing.</li>
                    <li class="answer">Added image to the PG part that couldn`t be reproduced by writing since it is too small and almost impossible to read in the original poster.</li>
                    <li class="question">6. Include some inline, embedded, or external CSS rules to visually control a variety of aspects of the 
                        page text (colour, font-family, font-size, alignment, line-height, line-height, etc.). Do your best to approximate the 
                        appearance of the original text of the movie poster you selected for the assignment - it does not need to look exactly 
                        the same.</li>
                    <li class="answer"> I added a variety of css to each line to make it look the most accurate. For example I found the 
                        ttf font of the letters of the name of the movie that didn`t exist in the Google fonts</li>
                    <li class="question">Validate the resulting HTML document (proceed to <a href="http://validator.w3.org">
                        http://validator.w3.org</a>).</li>
                    <li class="answer"> Index, Original Poster and About - Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>TAKE IT FURTHER</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="question">7. Try to use an image search to find a PNG or JPG version of your selected poster without any text - 
                        download the image. Use the following CSS to apply the PNG or JPG as a background image to your HTML document:
                        <pre> html {
                            background-image: url("../images/poster-image-background-filename.jpg");
                            background-size: cover;
                            }
                        </pre> </li>
                    <li class="answer"> The background image was included as backgroun image using a container. The css not only
                        describes the including, but also the height, the size, adjust position. </li>    
                    <li class="question">8. Use a Web font service like Google Fonts to emulate the type as it appears on the 
                        real movie poster.</li>
                    <li class="answer">I found some fonts on Google but they were not as equal as the font Amity Jack.
                        I downloaded it from another source and put it in a folder here.</li>    
                    <li class="question">9. Add some interesting images using the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element.</li>
                    <li class="answer"> I added the image of the Original Poster, and an image to the reproduction.</li>
                </ul>
